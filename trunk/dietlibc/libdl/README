  fixing the copy-relocation bug.

  TODO as last time.... plus
	- dlsym with RTLD_NEXT

  Ups.. misunderstood the manual-page of dlopen.
  now dlopen(0,...) works the way it is described in the susv2, BUT still not
  complete.

  TODO:
	- gdb support

	- RTLD_GLOBAL/RTLD_LOCAL
    at the moment ALL are GLOBAL.

	- open of a shared object ONCE
    there is no library hard-, symlink detection yet.

	- code for other archs then i386 and arm

  this unified libdl/dynlinker is now the default.

  the unified libdl/dynlinker now seems to stand the NORMAL usage so I think
  it should be tested outside my CLEANROOM :)

  ufffff.... now the libdl code can be used in the libdl.so :)
  Status: it works in my clean room on i386, arm-code started

  TODO: see below :)

  It work good enough to make a libdietc.so possible.

  Status: test-pre-alpha code
  the code is now "testable" ...
  I need a dyn-dietlibc specific ld.so. (in work)

  TODO: rebuild the code in a more readable and consistent way.


INITIAL May ? :

  Status: test-pre-pre-alpha code

  Shouldn't work yet. Had and have some problems with the elf specs...
  and more inconsistencies...
