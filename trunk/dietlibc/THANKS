The malloc code was done by Olaf Dreesen, who also helped with the SPARC
start code and fork().  Olaf also did the printf and scanf routines and
he implemented pthreads (wow!) and his now writing a dynamic linker, and
he ported the diet libc to S/390.

Thomas Ogrisegg ported the diet libc to PA-RISC and IA64 and fixed a few things.

I initially took some syscalls from Redhat minilibc, but the code has
been completely replaced now.

I initially took localtime and the directory reading routines from
uClibc, but the code has been completely replaced now.

syslog and crypt were contributed by René Müller.

Jeff Garzik contributed {get,set}{pw,gr,sp}ent.

Uwe Ohse went through the code and fixed many bugs.

Frank Klemm contributed the math library and a lot of correctness and
smallness patches and rewrote many functions in ix86 assembly language.

Erik Troan found several important bugs and sent in patches to fix them.

I also grabbed code from glibc (mostly assembly routines), and looked at
the OpenBSD libc for inspiration.

Michal Ludvig did the porting to x86_64 and Gwenole Beauchesne helped
finish the port.  Gwenole also reported many bugs and helped with some
of the more obscure platforms.

Johannes Stezenbach improved the MIPS port.

Marian Jancar added s390x and ppc64 support.

Gerrit Pape maintains the Debian port and helped immensely by relaying
bug reports and doing testing on platforms I didn't have access to.

Manuel Novoa III reported many bugs although he really works for the
competition, uClibc ;-)
