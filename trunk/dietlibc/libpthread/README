LIBPTHREAD

  This is the pthread implementation for the dietlibc.
  Written from scratch by Olaf Dreesen.

It's like linuxthreads a clone base thread implementation.


STATUS:
	near complete and should work (see KNOWN BUGS) on all dietlibc
	platforms that have a working implementation of:
	- clone
	- testandset
	- sigsetjmp/siglongjmp


KNOWN BUGS:
	- gdb can't handle this implementation.
	- there are problems with the stdio functions....
	- ia64 doesn't work. the problem is this f**king separate register
	  stack


MAYBE BUGS:
	- ia64: r13 is used as a pointer to the thread-struct
	- s390: a0 used as pointer to thread-struct
	- sparc/sparc64: g6 used as pointer to thread-struct


NOTES:
	SIGRTMAX and SIGRTMAX-1 are used by this imlementation !
	- SIGRTMAX   as restart event (join,cond_*wait,...)
	- SIGRTMAX-1 as cancel envent (cancel).
